The US Supreme Court has lifted the temporary suspension of a 1798 law allowing President Trump to deport immigrants accused of being affiliated with a criminal organization in Venezuela, known as the "Tren de Aragua", without a formal trial. The decision, made by a 5-4 vote, allows the deportations to continue, although the immigrant must be given the opportunity to appeal their removal.
